# Cannonball
Cannonball is a pentest tool used for information gathering and OSINT. It's centered in enterprise security where you'll have to document and download what you find in a very structured way. This tool is a cluster of many local and online OSINT softwares created by other users. What I've made it's just put all of those together.  

## How does it work?
When you have completed the process of installation, you will have to execute: 
```bash
bash Cannonball.sh
```
Then a text appears. You'll have to introduce your domain and your directory name and wait. When the process is finished, you will have a folder with the name that you puted. Inside you'll find all the output files ready to be documented. 


### What modules does Cannonball use?
This program it's a bash script that uses different modules and OSINT tools. At the moment we are using this ones:
* TheHarvester
* Amass
* Shcheck
* Testssl
