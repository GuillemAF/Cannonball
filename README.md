# Cannonball
Cannonball is a pentest tool used for information gathering and OSINT. It's centered in enterprise security where you'll have to document and download what you find in a very structured way. This tool is a cluster of many local and online OSINT softwares created by other users. What I've made it's just put all of those together.
