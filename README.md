# Cannonball
Cannonball is a pentest tool used for information gathering and OSINT. It's centered in enterprise security where you'll have to document and download what you find in a very structured way. This tool is a cluster of many local OSINT softwares created by other users. What I've made it's just put all of those together. It consists of a bash script that you execute and input a domain and a folder name and it saves all the information that tools gather in .json format.  

## What modules does Cannonball use?
This program it's a bash script that uses different modules and OSINT tools. At the moment we are using this ones:
* TheHarvester
* Amass
* Shcheck
* Testssl
* Wfuzz
* Curl
* DnsRecon
* Whatweb
* Spiderfoot

### Installation guide
This tool requires a little bit of a "set up". Here are the instructions:  

To proceed with the installation you'll have to run this command on your bash shell:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuillemAF/Cannonball.git
```

Another thing you have to do to get this program running properly, is to install this github repositories and have them in the same directory ("Cannonball"). Cannonball.sh script is prepeared to launch those programs from that ubication.  
To do this, you will have to run the following commands:  
  
(Make sure that you are in "Cannonball" directory)  
  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh.git
git clone https://github.com/santoru/shcheck.git
```
also, you will have to have TheHarvester and Amass isntalled too. You can do this by typing:

```bash
sudo apt-get install theharvester & sudo apt-get install amass
```
Then install jq (jason parser for bash);
```bash
sudo apt-get install jq
```
You will have to install spiderfoot also.


Then install wfuzz if you don't have it already. kali linux has it already installed so it's a lot easier.
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y wfuzz
```  
Next if you don't have it, you will need to install Whatweb and DnsRecon.
That's it. You have succesfully installed Cannonball on your machine.

### How does it work?
Once you've completed the process of installation, you will have to execute: 
```bash
bash Cannonball.sh -h
```
When you do that then, a text appears. This text is like a man page that theaches you the diferent parameters that can be used in the script.
At the moment only the following parameters exist:
    -   d       Input domain.
    -   f       Input the name of the folder.
    -   c       Extract headers with curl of all the subdomains gathered by theHarvester and amass.
    -   w       Webfuzzing with wfuzz.
    -   e       Exctract encryption information about all the subdomains gathered by theHarvester and amass.

When the process is finished, you will have a folder with the name that you introduced previousley. Inside you'll find all the output files ready to be documented.  
This way you can have as many directories as you want containing the domains that you entered.
